Following is the structure of the repository :

* data - contains various sample programs
* data/Sample_Programs/Programs - contains various examples in the language source code
* data/Sample_Programs/Respective Intermediate Code - contains intermediate code that is generated for the respective source code examples
* doc - contains all the related documents for the project, including the pitch,design and implementation PPTs, and one consolidated PDF containing the three PPTs
* doc/javadocs - contains java docs for the compiler and the runtime. We highly recommend seeing the Java docs as it provides a quick glimpse of the entire implementation.
* src - contains the entire source code
* src/compiler - contains the source code for the compiler
* src/runtime - contains the source code for the runtime
* lib - contains the dependencies used for this project (ANTLR)
* build.xml - This is the ant based build script that can be used to build and install the language
* build - This folder contains the generated class files for our language. 


# Installation

### Build
We assume the system already has ant installed. If not, please skip the build part. These commands should be executed at the root level of this repository.

```sh
$ ant init
$ ant compile
```

### Run
You can choose to build the source code again, or you can directly use the build folder. To run, please execute the following commands from the root level of this repository. The source file should also be at the root level. 

#### OSX/Unix/Linux users

```sh
$ java -cp "lib/*:build" rammCompiler fileToExecute.ramm
$ java -cp build Ramm generatedFile.rammc
```
where fileToExecute.ramm is the source file, and generatedFile.rammc is the generated intermediate code.

#### Windows users

```sh
$ java -cp "lib/*;build" rammCompiler fileToExecute.ramm
$ java -cp build Ramm generatedFile.rammc
```
where fileToExecute.ramm is the source file, and generatedFile.rammc is the generated intermediate code.
